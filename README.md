# ASP.NET Core MVC - Issue Management System
This application was designed for the IT department of University Centre Somerset to use to track and manage issues with IT systems. Assets were able to be 
recorded into the application, and assigned to a issue ticket, with a date, title, description and status of the ticket.
IT support staff are able to manage the tickets, and any user of the system can log an issue with any of the IT Assets.
